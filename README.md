# AnonStreak – Anonymous Chat Web App

AnonStreak is a privacy-first anonymous chat web app that connects users with strangers in a safe, ephemeral environment. Users can enter the platform completely anonymously or optionally create an account — even then, their identity remains hidden at all times.

If two users enjoy chatting, they can choose to start a streak, allowing them to reconnect and chat again each day while staying fully anonymous. All conversations are temporary: messages auto-delete, creating a clean, safe, and minimal social experience with no history and no pressure.

***Key ideas behind AnonStreak:***

- 100% anonymous chat with strangers
- Optional account system to maintain streaks while staying anonymous
- Streaks let two users reconnect daily without revealing identities
- Ephemeral messaging — everything auto-deletes
- Lightweight, safe, privacy-centric social interaction
